# Trust Model

The trust model is intentionally narrow: governed MCP tool calls are the first
hard trust boundary.

## Signed Permits

`POST /v1/permits` creates Ed25519-signed authority for a wallet-scoped agent.
A permit binds:

- issuer wallet
- subject wallet
- optional subject API key
- allowed tools
- scopes such as `tool:{tool_name}:invoke` and `billing:charge`
- maximum credits
- expiry
- nonce
- revocation state

Permit creation requires `Idempotency-Key`. Reusing the same key with the same
request returns the original permit. Reusing it with a different request fails
with `409 Conflict`.

## Governed MCP Calls

A governed MCP call supplies `permit_id` and `idempotency_key` in `mcpContext`
or the `Idempotency-Key` header. The server validates wallet binding, key
binding, tool scope, budget, expiry, revocation, and signature before charging.

Legacy wallet-only MCP calls remain available while `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED=false`.
Production trust mode should run with `ALLOW_LEGACY_UNPERMITTED_MCP=false`.

## Exactly-Once Debit, Bound To The Idempotency Record

This is the primitive the rest of the model exists to protect, and the one that
distinguishes this system — signed receipts do not (see
[`WEDGE.md`](WEDGE.md) §"Signed receipts are table stakes now").

One accepted idempotency key produces **at most one gateway dispatch and at most
one ledger debit**, linked by a single persisted chain — and **exactly one
receipt on every path that finalizes or reconciles**. The ledger entry carries
the idempotency record's identity as its `operation_key` under a uniqueness
constraint, so a duplicate debit cannot be written even if two processes race.
Replaying the same request under the same accepted key returns the original
result and receipt without a second dispatch or debit; replaying a *changed*
request under that key fails closed with `409 Conflict`.

**Why "at most one" and not "exactly one."** Two real paths produce neither a
dispatch nor a net debit, and one produces no receipt at all:

- A crash *before* dispatch is reconciled to a refund, so the call never
  dispatched and the wallet nets zero
  (`test_kill_between_debit_and_dispatch_refunds_without_dispatching`).
- A **local** governed tool that crashes *after* its side effect leaves one
  execution and one debit with **no receipt**, permanently `needs_manual_review`;
  reconciliation deliberately does not finalize it, and replay stays
  in-progress rather than redispatching
  (`test_post_side_effect_crash_requires_review_without_redispatch` asserts
  `receipt_ids == ()`).

The guarantee is therefore never a duplicate charge, not always a charge — and
the receipt guarantee holds for the upstream path and every reconcilable
outcome, not for the local post-effect crash. Overstating this as "exactly one
receipt" would contradict the crash behaviour documented below.

Budgets are enforced before money moves: a permit's cap is checked in the same
atomic conditional update that consumes it, so concurrent invocations cannot
overspend it.

**Ambiguity is a first-class durable state.** For the configured upstream MCP
tool, a dispatch attempt is persisted through
`prepared → dispatched → {succeeded, returned_error, delivery_uncertain,
response_rejected}`. If the process dies after the request left the gateway but
before an acknowledgement arrived, recovery classifies the attempt as
`delivery_uncertain`: **the charge stands and the call is never redispatched**,
because non-delivery can no longer be proven. Local (non-upstream) governed tools
have no dispatch state machine; a crash there fails closed into manual review
instead. See [`docs/failure-semantics.md`](docs/failure-semantics.md).

This is at-most-one *gateway* dispatch plus refusal to redispatch an ambiguous
invocation. It is **not** effect-once inside an arbitrary upstream tool, which
requires that tool to honour the forwarded idempotency key.

## Signed Receipts

Every successful governed MCP call produces a signed receipt linked to the
permit, ledger entry, audit event, tool, request hash, response hash, and cost.
Denied and failed governed attempts produce signed denial/failure receipts when
a valid permit was present.

The receipt's Ed25519 signature covers the **ledger entry, the idempotency
record, and the dispatch attempt together**, so the issuer's statement about
authority, money, and delivery outcome is one tamper-evident unit rather than
three separable assertions. Signed receipts are widely available elsewhere; that
binding is what this signature adds.

**What offline verification does and does not establish.** The portable bundle
(`GET /v1/receipts/{id}/portable`) carries the `signing_input`, the signature,
and a key reference — not the ledger or dispatch records themselves. A holder
with no credential here can therefore verify that *this issuer signed these
identifiers together and nothing has been altered since*. They cannot
independently confirm that the named ledger entry carries the matching
`operation_key`, because that record does not travel with the bundle.

That consistency is enforced where the records are written — `attach_charge`
rejects a ledger row whose `operation_key` is not the idempotency record, and
`receipts.idempotency_record_id` / `dispatch_attempt_id` are unique foreign
keys — and it is checkable after the fact through the authenticated evidence
bundle (`GET /v1/receipts/{id}/evidence`). So the correct claim is **signed and
tamper-evident offline; consistency enforced at write time and auditable
online** — never "the linkage is verifiable offline."

## Audit Chain

Control-plane audit events include a payload hash, previous hash, chain hash,
signature, and signing key ID. `/v1/audit/verify-chain` verifies wallet-scoped
audit integrity and detects silent mutation.

## Key Material

The database stores public keys and key metadata only. Production private keys
must come from configured secret material or KMS-backed injection. Local tests
may use process-ephemeral keys; they are not persisted.
