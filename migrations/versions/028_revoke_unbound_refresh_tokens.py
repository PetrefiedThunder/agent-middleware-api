"""Revoke refresh tokens that cannot be bound to their minting API key.

Revision 025 added ``refresh_tokens.key_id`` but left historical rows NULL.
Wallet-level fallback is unsafe when a revoked key has a live sibling: an
unbound token could rotate forever through that sibling. The application now
fails closed on NULL bindings, and this data migration durably revokes every
historical row that cannot be attributed to a key.
