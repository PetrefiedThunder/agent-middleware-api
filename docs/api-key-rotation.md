# Environment API Key Rotation

Runbook for rotating the bootstrap-admin keys in `VALID_API_KEYS`. This is
the companion to `docs/key-management.md`, which covers the Ed25519
trust-plane signing key; this document covers the env-based API keys that
`app/core/auth.py` treats as bootstrap admins.

**Out of scope:** the static `amw_dev_` development/training keys in
`STATIC_DEV_API_KEYS` are deliberately never rotated. They authenticate
only in local-compatible environments and a production-like deployment
refuses to boot with them set, so the leak-means-compromise threat model
below does not apply to them. See `docs/static-dev-api-keys.md`.

## Why these keys matter

Any key listed in `VALID_API_KEYS` authenticates as a **bootstrap admin**:
it passes `require_bootstrap_admin()`, can read the full audit plane, mint
wallets, and create DB-backed wallet keys. A leak of one env key is
therefore a full-control compromise of the API surface, and the only
remediation is rotation at the host — deleting the key from the repo
removes it from neither git history nor existing clones.

## Incident record

| Date | Key | Exposure | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-06 | `agent-middleware-secret-99` | Hardcoded in `scripts/stress_test_live.py`, reachable on public `main` (removed from HEAD in #201; `main`'s flattened history no longer contains it, but an all-refs gitleaks scan on 2026-08-24 confirmed it remains reachable on stale unmerged branches that preserve the pre-flatten history, and in old clones — prune those branches before or when making the repository public) | 2026-08-07: `VALID_API_KEYS` fully replaced on Railway and cutover completed via dashboard Redeploy of the last good deployment (variable-triggered rebuilds were crash-looping on the stale `master` trigger — see warning below). Verified with `rotate_api_keys.py verify`: retired key rejected (403), replacement accepted (200) |

## Rotation procedure (Railway)

1. **Generate replacements** (never reuse or hand-write keys):

   ```bash
   python scripts/rotate_api_keys.py generate --count 2
   ```

2. **Set the new list** on the `api-service` service in the Railway
   dashboard (project `agent-middleware-api` → `api-service` → Variables):
   replace `VALID_API_KEYS` with the comma-separated new keys. Do not
   append — the point of rotation is that the old list dies. Railway
   redeploys the service on variable change; `get_settings()` is cached
   per process, so the new list only takes effect with that restart.

   > **Warning:** a variable change is only live once a *healthy*
   > deployment cuts over. A restart is not enough — restarts reuse the
   > deployment's env snapshot from creation time. And as of 2026-08-07
   > the service's GitHub trigger builds the stale `master` branch, which
   > fails `alembic upgrade head` (missing revision `3988bd05deca`), so a
   > variable-triggered rebuild crash-loops and the old replica — with
   > the old keys — keeps serving. Until that trigger is fixed (point it
   > at `main`, or disconnect it per `docs/deploy-railway.md` and use the
   > Deploy to Railway workflow), cut over by clicking **Redeploy** on
   > the last successful deployment in the dashboard, which reuses its
   > image with freshly resolved variables.

3. **Verify** once the deploy is live:

   ```bash
   export AGENT_MIDDLEWARE_API_URL=https://api.thisisatest.tech
   export OLD_API_KEY=<retired key>
   export NEW_API_KEY=<replacement key>
   python scripts/rotate_api_keys.py verify
   ```

   The verifier asserts the retired key gets 401/403 and the replacement
   gets 200 on `GET /v1/audit/summary` (read-only, admin-gated). Non-zero
   exit means the rotation is NOT complete — stop and investigate.

4. **Distribute** the new key to legitimate operators out of band. Update
   any local `.env` files and CI secret stores that carry a copy
   (currently none — CI holds only `RAILWAY_TOKEN`).

## Post-rotation audit

An env key is a bootstrap admin, so assume a leaked one was used until the
audit trail says otherwise:

- `GET /v1/audit/summary` and `GET /v1/audit/events` — look for wallet
  creation, permit issuance, or governed invokes you don't recognize in
  the exposure window.
- Review DB-backed keys (`APIKeyModel`) created during the window: a
  bootstrap admin can mint wallet keys that survive env-key rotation.
  Rotate or revoke any that cannot be attributed — `POST
  /v1/api-keys/rotate` per key, or `POST /v1/api-keys/emergency-revoke`
  to kill every key on a wallet at once.
- Replacement keys never widen authority: a rotated key inherits the old
  key's expiry and *remaining* `max_uses` budget (rotating a use-budgeted
  key requires `revoke_old: true`, otherwise the remaining budget would
  exist twice), and an emergency replacement takes both its bounds from
  one donor credential: the active, non-expired key (exhausted ones
  included, so a key spending its final use on the emergency call cannot
  mint itself an unbounded replacement) with the largest remaining
  budget, tie-broken by latest expiry. To issue a
  key with fresh bounds, mint one explicitly with `POST /v1/api-keys`.
- The trust-plane signing key (`TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`) is a
  separate secret that has never been committed; it does not need rotation
  for an API-key leak. If you suspect it anyway, follow the compromise
  flow in `docs/key-management.md`.

## What prevents recurrence

- CI secret scanning (`.gitleaks.toml`) fails the build on any
  credential-named variable bound to a string literal, the exact shape of
  the 2026-08-06 leak.
- `scripts/stress_test_live.py` and `scripts/trust_plane_conformance.py`
  exit non-zero when `AGENT_MIDDLEWARE_API_KEY` is unset instead of
  falling back to a default.
- Keys generated by `scripts/rotate_api_keys.py` carry the `amw_live_`
  prefix so a future leak is greppable and matches vendor-style secret
  scanners, unlike the dictionary-word key that evaded entropy rules.
