# Market Research: MCP Governance And Metering (2026-08)

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Scope:** External market sizing, problem evidence, and the MCP-native
competitive set for the wedge defined in [`../WEDGE.md`](../WEDGE.md).

> ## Provenance and verification discipline
>
> This document originated as an external research brief, not as repo-verified
> analysis. Before committing it, each load-bearing claim was checked against a
> primary source. The result is recorded per claim in the **Verification**
> columns below, using the same levels as
> [`related-work.md`](related-work.md):
>
> - **Verified** — checked against the primary source named in the row.
> - **Single-source** — the claim exists, but rests on one vendor's report or
>   one project's own marketing. Usable as context, not as evidence.
> - **Unverified** — carried over from the brief and not independently checked.
>   Do not put an unverified row into customer-facing copy.
>
> Three claims in the original brief were **wrong or misleading** and are
> corrected in [§5](#5-corrections-to-the-original-brief). One of them —
> the claim that no competitor pairs a network boundary with offline-verifiable
> receipts — was load-bearing for positioning, and its correction changes the
> recommended pitch.

## 1. Market Sizing

| Metric | Value | Source | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP market, 2025 | USD 1.20B | [SNS Insider, MCP Market 2026–2035](https://www.snsinsider.com/reports/model-context-protocol-market-10725) | Single-source |
| MCP market, 2035 (projected) | USD 28.36B | same | Single-source |
| CAGR 2026–2035 | 37.22% | same | Single-source |
| Security & governance sub-segment CAGR | 44.56% | attributed to the same report | **Unverified** — the headline figures were confirmed, the sub-segment split was not |
| MCP servers in the wild | 5,800+ | ecosystem trackers | Unverified |
| MCP clients | 300+ | ecosystem trackers | Unverified |
| Monthly MCP SDK downloads | 97M+ | ecosystem trackers | Unverified |

**How to use this section.** Every figure here comes from a single analyst
firm or from uncited ecosystem trackers. Treat it as evidence that the category
is *taken seriously by analysts*, not as a sized addressable market. Do not put
a dollar figure on a slide without naming SNS Insider next to it.

The directional claim that survives scrutiny is weaker but still useful:
governance and security are consistently framed by outside analysts as the
fastest-growing part of MCP tooling, and the competitive set in §3 grew from
near-empty to crowded inside roughly six months. That is observable directly
and does not need a market model.

## 2. Problem Evidence

The failure this repo exists to prevent — an agent framework retrying a
timed-out tool call and producing a second charge — is documented in production
by parties with no stake in this product.

| Evidence | What it establishes | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| [stripe/ai#402](https://github.com/stripe/ai/issues/402), "Agent-level retry creates duplicate charges — no idempotency guard above the tool layer" (open, 2026-05-03) | The strongest single piece of external evidence. The reporter documents that the Stripe SDK's idempotency keys cover *network-level* retries within a session, while agent frameworks retry as a **new invocation with a freshly generated key**, producing duplicate charges. They explicitly conclude the fix belongs "above the tool layer." | **Verified** — issue read directly |
| [OpenBB-finance/OpenBB#7455](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/issues/7455), "Signed audit receipts for MCP server tool calls (regulatory compliance)" | A production MCP operator asking for signed per-call evidence, and being pointed at a third-party gateway rather than anything native. | **Verified** — issue located |
| Practitioner writing on idempotency in agentic tool calling | Frames this as a distributed-systems problem the agent layer imported without the corresponding patterns. | Unverified — the specific essay cited in the brief was not located |
| Vendor commentary on retry-driven cost amplification | Agents retrying on data-layer timeouts multiply per-step cost. | Unverified |

**Why stripe/ai#402 matters more than the rest.** It is a third party,
independently, describing the exact mechanism in
[`ELEVATOR_PITCH.md`](../ELEVATOR_PITCH.md)'s ten-second pitch — and arriving
at the same architectural conclusion, that the guard has to sit above the tool.
It is the one citation strong enough to use in a design-partner conversation.
It does **not** establish that anyone will pay for a gateway to fix it.

## 3. MCP-Native Competitive Set

The existing [`COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`](COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md) compares this
system against Stripe, AWS IAM, Okta, and Vault — general-purpose incumbents.
That comparison is still useful for architecture, but it is no longer the
competitive reality. The nearer competitors are MCP-native and recent.

| Project | What it is | Nearest overlap | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| [protect-mcp / ScopeBlind gateway](https://github.com/tomjwxf/scopeblind-gateway) | stdio proxy in front of an MCP server. Intercepts `tools/call`, evaluates Cedar + JSON policy per tool, emits optional Ed25519-signed decision receipts verifiable without calling the issuer. MIT, shadow mode by default, IETF Internet-Draft for the receipt format. | **The closest competitor.** Network boundary + per-tool policy + offline-verifiable Ed25519 receipts. No wallet, budget, or charge-once semantics. | **Verified** |
| [jamjet-labs/jamjet](https://github.com/jamjet-labs/jamjet) | Open-source safety layer: one `policy.yaml` across hooks, guardrails, MCP gateways, and SDKs; blocks unsafe calls, requires approval, enforces budgets, audits, replays. Signed receipts with a hash-chained `previousReceiptHash` and pre/post-execution signatures. | Policy portability + HITL approval + budget enforcement + chained signed receipts. Broader surface, many framework adapters. | **Verified** |
| [sangaraju1988/latch](https://github.com/sangaraju1988/latch) | MIT Python **library** (decorators/wrappers, not a proxy): idempotency, circuit breaker, timeout, budget guardrail, saga/compensation. Redis backend for cross-process idempotency; OpenAI and LangChain adapters. | Idempotency + budget caps, in-process. **No signed receipts.** | **Verified** |
| [TraceAgent](https://www.traceagent.dev/) | Append-only audit receipts with SHA-256 hash chains, authority trails linking actions to approving humans, one-click compliance exports mapped to EU AI Act / Colorado AI Act / ISO 42001. Zero-config for MCP tool calls. | Audit and compliance evidence. No metering or charge-once semantics. | **Verified** (from vendor site) |
| [microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) | Policy enforcement, zero-trust identity, sandboxing, reliability engineering; an active proposal for independently verifiable compliance receipts. | A large vendor moving into verifiable receipts. Strategic risk more than a current competitor. | **Verified** |
| Tork Governance MCP Server | PII detection, policy enforcement, compliance receipts, kill switch, HITL. | Security-focused governance. | Unverified |
| SecureAuth Agent Authority | Enterprise IAM for agents: OAuth 2.1, CIBA HITL, anomaly detection, revocation. | Identity, upstream of this product. Not a competitor. | Unverified |
| AGA MCP Server, AgentMesh, Agent Receipts, MCPTotal, Pomerium, SGNL | Assorted MCP security gateways and receipt tools named in adoption guides. | Category noise; individually unassessed. | Unverified |

## 4. Where This Product Actually Sits

The brief claimed the unique intersection was *idempotency + metering +
offline-verifiable receipts at a network boundary*. Verification does not
support that, because protect-mcp already occupies the boundary-plus-receipts
half of it.

What survives is narrower and, usefully, matches
[`WEDGE.md`](../WEDGE.md) as already written:

| Dimension | Here | protect-mcp | jamjet | latch | TraceAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enforces at a network boundary | ✅ | ✅ (stdio proxy) | ✅ (adapters + gateway) | ❌ (in-process library) | ✅ |
| Per-tool policy / scope | ✅ (signed permits) | ✅ (Cedar) | ✅ (policy.yaml) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Offline-verifiable signed receipts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (hash chain) |
| Hash-chained audit | ✅ (per-wallet) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Budget enforcement | ✅ (wallet ledger) | ❌ | ✅ (caps) | ✅ (guardrail) | ❌ |
| Idempotency / no duplicate execution | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (replay) | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Debit bound to the idempotency record** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Ambiguous post-dispatch outcome is a distinct, receipted state** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Human-in-the-loop approval | ✅ (permit requests) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (authority trail) |
| Compliance framework mapping | ❌ (deliberate) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

Read down the bolded rows. Several projects have receipts; several have
budgets; several have idempotency. The cell nobody else occupies is that **one
accepted idempotency key produces exactly one ledger debit and one receipt, and
the record linking them is a single persisted chain** — plus the refusal to
silently redispatch when the outcome is genuinely unknown
(`delivery_uncertain`, per `ELEVATOR_PITCH.md`).

That is a smaller claim than "the only gateway with receipts." It is also the
only one that is true, and it is the one this codebase can actually demonstrate
with `make prove-trust-plane`.

## 5. Corrections To The Original Brief

Recorded rather than silently edited, matching the convention at the top of
[`COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`](COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md).

| Claim in the brief | Verified reality |
|---|---|
| "No one owns that exact cell" — idempotency + metering + offline-verifiable receipts at a boundary | **Overclaim, and load-bearing.** protect-mcp is a proxy with per-tool Cedar policy and Ed25519 receipts verifiable without calling the issuer. Boundary + offline receipts is taken. The defensible claim is the *economic* half: a debit bound to the idempotency record. |
| "JamJet ADK" as a product name | **Conflation.** The project is `jamjet-labs/jamjet`, a general open-source agent safety layer; Google ADK is one of many framework adapters, not the product. |
| "Signed offline receipts ❌" for latch | Directionally right but for the wrong reason — latch has no receipts *at all*, signed or otherwise. It is a reliability library, not an evidence layer. It is also not a governance competitor: it competes for the *engineer's build-vs-buy decision*, which is a different fight. |
| Market sizing presented as established fact | Traces to one analyst report (SNS Insider). The headline figures check out as that firm's published numbers; the 44.56% governance sub-segment CAGR could not be confirmed at all. |

## 6. Strategic Implications

### Real advantages

1. **The problem has third-party production evidence.** stripe/ai#402 is
   someone else describing this failure and concluding the fix belongs above
   the tool layer.
2. **Identity is not contested.** SecureAuth, Okta, and Auth0 own who may call.
   This product answers what happened and what it cost — downstream, and
   complementary. `ELEVATOR_PITCH.md` already refuses the IAM framing.
3. **The one-tool constraint reads as honest, not limited,** in a market where
   buyers are governing one critical tool rather than ten.
4. **Executable proof is differentiated** in a field of marketing claims.
   `make prove-trust-plane` needs no credentials and no trust in the vendor.

### Real risks

1. **protect-mcp is closer than the brief suggested,** is MIT-licensed, is
   already integrated with Microsoft Autogen, and has an IETF Internet-Draft
   for its receipt format. A draft standard for receipts is the more serious
   threat: if the receipt format standardizes elsewhere, receipts become table
   stakes and only the ledger semantics differentiate.
2. **Microsoft is in the category.** `agent-governance-toolkit` has an open
   proposal for independently verifiable compliance receipts. Assume the
   evidence layer commoditizes.
3. **latch wins the default build-vs-buy.** Free, MIT, `pip install`, no
   operational surface. The honest answer is that a library the agent can
   bypass is not a boundary, and an in-process cache is not evidence — but that
   argument has to be made explicitly, and it only wins when the buyer needs
   evidence rather than reliability.
4. **Compliance positioning is absent, deliberately.** TraceAgent maps to EU AI
   Act, Colorado AI Act, and ISO 42001. `WEDGE.md` forbids compliance-grade
   claims and that prohibition should stand. The available move is a bounded
   FAQ answer — receipts are one input an auditor may accept, the operator's
   auditor decides — not a compliance page.
5. **Category language is exhausted.** "Trust plane" and "governance gateway"
   are occupied, as `WEDGE.md` already notes. Differentiation has to come from
   the debit, not the vocabulary.

### Positioning consequences

The subheadline proposed in the brief — *"the only MCP gateway that meters by
the call, prevents double-charges on retry, and returns a signed receipt you
can verify without us"* — contains a superlative that verification does not
support and that `ELEVATOR_PITCH.md`'s closing section forbids. The
receipt-you-can-verify-without-us part is true but no longer exclusive.

The version that is both differentiated and defensible drops the superlative
and leads with the debit:

> One agent action, one debit — no matter how many times the agent retries.
> Verify the receipt without us.

See [`../WEDGE.md`](../WEDGE.md) and [`../ELEVATOR_PITCH.md`](../ELEVATOR_PITCH.md)
for the copy as adopted, and `site/compare/` for the public comparison page
built from §3 and §4.

## 7. Open Questions

1. Does the 44.56% governance sub-segment CAGR exist in the SNS Insider report,
   or was it interpolated? Do not repeat it until someone reads the report.
2. What is in protect-mcp's IETF Internet-Draft, and does the receipt format
   have room for a ledger reference? If so, interoperating beats competing.
3. Does `jamjet` bind its budget enforcement to its replay records, or are they
   independent subsystems? This determines whether the bolded row in §4 stays
   true.
4. Do design-partner conversations actually surface duplicate-charge incidents,
   or is stripe/ai#402 an articulate outlier? One partner interview settles it.
5. Would a buyer with an EU AI Act mandate reject a vendor with no compliance
   mapping outright, or accept receipts as one input among several?
