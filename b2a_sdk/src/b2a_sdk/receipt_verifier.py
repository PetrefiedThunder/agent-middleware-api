"""Offline verification of trust-plane receipts.

A receipt is portable evidence when someone can check its signature using a
public key they trust. Everything in this module therefore runs with no
network, no database, and no credential: it takes a portable receipt bundle
plus a caller-supplied key set and answers whether the signature holds. Key
distribution and issuer identity remain the caller's trust decision.

Two rules keep that answer meaningful:

1. Every field this module reports is read out of the *signed bytes*. Nothing
   is taken from the enclosing bundle, which is unauthenticated envelope data.
   A bundle claiming ``receipt_id: X`` around a payload for ``Y`` is rejected.
2. Failure is never silently "false". An unreachable key set, an unknown key,
   and a bad signature are different situations, and a caller that cannot tell
   them apart will eventually read an outage as fraud. See
   :class:`VerificationStatus`.

Typical use::

    from b2a_sdk.receipt_verifier import verify_bundle

    result = verify_bundle(bundle, key_set)
    if result.ok:
        print(result.claims["tool"], result.claims["credits_charged"])

The only dependency beyond the standard library is ``cryptography``, installed
via the ``verify`` extra::

    pip install "b2a-sdk[verify]"
