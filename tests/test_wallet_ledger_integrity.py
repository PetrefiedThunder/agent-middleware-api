"""Wallet money moves must be decided by the database, not by a stale read.

Each path here read a balance or counter in one statement and wrote it back in
a later one, serialized only by ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``. That lock is a
silent no-op on SQLite, and nothing in this repository forbids SQLite in
production, so these are live on a supported configuration.

The interleaves are forced deterministically through an instrumented session
rather than raced, so they cannot pass by scheduling luck. Each test asserts
the interleave actually fired before asserting anything else.

    """Reversing one charge's velocity must not undo another's increment.

    When a charge is rejected after the velocity monitor already committed its
    increment, `reverse_velocity_record()` backs that increment out. It did so
    by reading `hourly_spent`/`daily_spent` and writing back read-charge — a
    read-modify-write, in the same function whose debit this PR had already
    converted to a guarded UPDATE. A charge committing in between is erased.

    That matters more than a skewed metric: these counters are what the spend
    cap and the anomaly auto-freeze are measured against. Losing an increment
    under-counts spend and quietly raises the ceiling; losing a *reversal*
    over-counts it and throttles a caller who never spent the money.

    Honest limit on what this proves: unlike the other tests in this file, it
    passes against the unfixed source as well. The only reversal branch this
    interleave can reliably reach is the lost-race one, and that branch calls
    ``session.refresh(wallet)`` first, which happens to make the stale read
    benign there. The five branches that reverse *without* a refresh are the
    exposed ones, and they need a rejection this harness cannot force on the
