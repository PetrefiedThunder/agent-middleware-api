    """Report how this image's commit SHA was established.

    ``get_build_commit_sha`` answers *which* SHA is running. This answers
    *where that answer came from*, which is what distinguishes a release built
    through the documented operator path from one Railway rebuilt on its own.

    Only ``railway up --build-arg COMMIT_SHA=...`` writes
    ``/app/.build_commit_sha``. Railway sets ``RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`` on any
    deployment it builds, including one triggered by a variable write against a
    connected GitHub source. On a correct operator build both exist and agree,
    so a disagreement — or a missing stamp — is the signature of a build that
    did not come through the SOP.

    Returns one of:

    - ``"stamped"`` — a valid baked stamp exists and, when the control plane
      also reports a SHA, the two agree. This is the only value a release built
      through the documented path can produce.
    - ``"mismatch"`` — both sources are valid and disagree. The image was built
      from one commit and deployed as another.
    - ``"control_plane_only"`` — no valid baked stamp; the SHA comes solely from
      Railway's deployment metadata. An operator build cannot produce this.
    - ``"unstamped"`` — neither source yields a valid SHA.

    This is a reporting surface, not a guardrail: it never raises and never
    changes which SHA is reported, so enabling it cannot take a running service
    down. Gate on it from the release preflight instead.
