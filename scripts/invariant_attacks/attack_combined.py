"""ATTACK 7 — Six-vector simultaneous assault.

The per-vector scripts (attacks 1-6) each attack ONE invariant in isolation.
This runs all six at once, against shared victim + attacker state, so
cross-vector contention is actually exercised: a budget race, a dedup race, a
scope-escape, a confused-deputy and a mid-flight crash all hammer the SAME
victim wallet simultaneously. Serial tests cannot surface an interaction that
only appears when the invariants are attacked together.

A pool of workers drives an interleaved job queue so every vector is in flight
at once (sustained contention), against victim wallet V:

  1 double-charge : K threads fire the SAME idempotency key + payload on a
                    high-cap "load" permit (P_load).
  2 budget cap    : M threads fire DISTINCT keys racing a small-cap permit
                    (P_budget, cap = BUDGET_CAP) — overspend attempt.
  3 scope escape  : threads invoke partner.notes.write through P_scope, whose
                    allowed_tools does NOT include it.
  6 credential    : garbage key / missing key / confused-deputy (attacker key B
                    driving V's permit) / cross-tenant permit issuance / a
                    revoked key.
  5 crash         : a killer SIGKILLs the server the instant committed debits on
                    V cross THRESHOLD — mid-storm. After restart every P_load and
                    P_budget key is replayed with its identical payload.
  4 forgery       : a SUCCESS receipt MINTED DURING THE STORM is tamper-checked
                    offline with the shipped b2a_sdk verifier.

Invariants asserted after restart + replay (ledger-centric; engine = sqlite):

  - no double charge : total committed debits on V <= distinct keys ever
                       attempted, and no single key is debited twice.
  - budget contained : P_budget.spent_credits <= P_budget.max_credits, and the
                       count of its success receipts * cost <= cap.
  - charge<->receipt : every success receipt's ledger_entry_id exists as a debit;
                       no permanent charged-without-proof beyond transient
                       idempotency_in_progress.
  - deny vectors held: no scope / credential request ever produced a SUCCESS or a
                       charge on V — even amid the crash. A connection reset on an
                       in-flight denied request is acceptable; an admitted call is
                       not. Verified by: (a) no live response carried a success
                       receipt, and (b) every success receipt on V belongs to
                       P_load or P_budget.
  - forgery held     : a storm-minted receipt verifies genuine, every tampered
                       signed field is INVALID, and an unknown key is UNDETERMINED
                       (never a false INVALID).

Needs a controllable server (so it can kill -9 + restart). See the README
"Six-vector simultaneous attack" recipe. Env: TP_PIDFILE, TP_BOOT, TP_SERVER_LOG,
TP_DB_PATH (the controlled instance's api.db), API_URL.
