/* ==========================================================================
   THE HUMAN WAITING ROOM — the door, not the room.

   /arcade.js is the largest thing the landing page can load, and nobody
   needs it until they press START. This file is what ships on every visit
   instead: it reveals the launcher (the arcade's proof of life used to be
   arcade.js itself running), and fetches /arcade.js and /arcade.css the
   first time someone asks for the room — on click, on a ?arcade= deep link,
   or speculatively on hover/focus so the click feels instant.

   Contracts this file lives inside, the same as arcade.js:

   - CSP is script-src 'self' / style-src 'self' with no 'unsafe-inline'. The
     script and stylesheet are injected as same-origin <script> and <link>
     elements, which the policy allows; nothing inline is created.
   - The launcher ships hidden and is revealed only once this script runs, so
     a visitor without JavaScript never sees a control that does nothing.
   - The asset URLs come from the launcher's data attributes, so the cache
     token lives in the HTML with every other asset reference and the build's
     token check covers them.
   - Once arcade.js has loaded it owns the launcher: it attaches its own click
     handler and handles ?arcade= itself, exactly as it did when it loaded
     eagerly. This file steps aside after the first load.
